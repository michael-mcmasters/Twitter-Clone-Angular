# Twitter Clone

This is a project I worked on over the summer before starting at Code Differently. My goal was to create a near pixel perfect clone without taking shortcuts to really understand CSS and to learn TypeScript. I found myself really enjoying both, especially TypeScript, because of its similarity to strongly-typed programming languages such as Java and C# which I also love using.

The project uses FontAwesome and Angular Material for its icons. And RxJS and CSS variables for the dark theme / light theme toggle. In the GIFs below you can see examples of hover transitions, sticky scrollable sidebars, styled input fields and a completely responsive design.

## To Run
```
git clone https://github.com/michael-mcmasters/Twitter-Clone-Angular.git
cd Twitter-Clone-Angular
npm install
ng serve --open
```
